member_poset_id_space has 3 ids.
begining at 0 and ending at 3 gathered

Iterate:
id: 0 hub id: 2 name: primitives_schema is a jim.
id: 1 hub id: 3 name: namespace_poset_schema is a jim.
id: 2 hub id: 4 name: primitives is a jim.

Reiterate:
scoped_id:  (2, 0) name: primitives_schema is a jim.
scoped_id:  (2, 1) name: namespace_poset_schema is a jim.
scoped_id:  (2, 2) name: primitives is a jim.
